# Deep-Style-Transfer-Algorithm
Algorithm to transfer the style of one picture to other

A style transfer algorithms learns the patrons of one picture and applies them to other. In this case the picture is a building of an important museum of my hometown. I've tried Monet and Van Gogh and the results were fascinating. I will write an article about the artistic view of Deep Learning in my Linkedln (https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-bonilla-salvador/).

The explanation of how it works is beyong the purpose of this post, but feel free to contact me for any questions.
